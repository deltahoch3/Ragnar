## Installation

There is a script for Ubuntu users, all of the process is automated:

```console
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suleyman-kaya/Ragnar/main/ubuntu_installation.sh)"
```
For Arch users there is also a installation script:

```console
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cococry/Ragnar/main/install/arch_installation.sh)"
```

If you want to run Ragnar on your machine, 
clone this repo and install all dependencies with your package manager.

### Install Dependencies
- git
- make
- gcc
- xorg
- xorg-xinit

Clone the repo
```console
git clone https://github.com/cococry/Ragnar
```

Installing the WM is as easy as
```console
cd Ragnar/
sudo make ragnar install
```

Then, in your ~/.xinitrc add:
```
exec ragnar
```

If you are using a session manager you need to add ragnar to your sessions:
```console
sudo cp ragnar.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/ragnar.desktop
```

### IMPORTANT

In the [config.h](https://github.com/cococry/Ragnar/blob/main/config.h) file specify your monitor
setup in order for the WM to work as intended. Also, for configuration of the WM use the config.h file.

## Notes

For the best experience, i suggest to use a X compositer like picom. I am using [picom pijulius](https://github.com/pijulius/picom)
because i think it has very clean animation support. You can find my picom config [here](https://github.com/cococry/dotfiles/blob/main/picom/picom.conf)

If you find bugs or have any problems with Ragnar, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/cococry/Ragnar/issues). 


## Inspiration

RagnarWM is mainly inspired by [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org).
I, myself used dwm as my main window manager in the past and 
i really liked the minimalist style of it. But i found
it really frustrating how the default dwm repository was
pretty much unusable out of the box. A lot
of main features are non-existend in dwm or 
poorly designed. That's why i was inspired to create
a minimal window manager that comes with usablity
out of the box. I don't think usablity and features
have to suffer with minimalism. But don't get
me wrong, dwm is a great window manager and i
had a really nice time using it.


## Usage

### Configuration
Configuring Ragnar is a similar process as configuring
 [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org). There is a config.h file
with macros you can change and lists you can change to
your liking. The config is written in a way, so that people
without any experience in C can read it and change it.

If you changed your configuration, just use:
```console
sudo make clean ragnar install
```

And Press Super + C to shutdown the WM.
Then, in the tty use *startx* to restart the WM.
